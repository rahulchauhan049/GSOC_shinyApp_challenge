# Biodiversity Data Visualizations
## For Spatial Data
### 1 Maps with grids
![Density Grid Map](assets/spatial/densitygridmap.PNG)
A density grid is a way to visualize and analyze point data by transforming the points into a regular grid. Each resulting grid cell is assigned a value that is determined by the density of nearby points, optionally weighting each point using a weighting value.

### 2 The bubble plot (on a map)
![Bubble](assets/spatial/bubble.png)
A bubble map uses circles of different size to represent a numeric value on a territory. It displays one bubble per geographic coordinate, or one bubble per region (in this case the bubble is usually displayed in the baricentre of the region).

### 3 Choropleth
![Chloropleth](assets/spatial/choropleth.png)
Choropleth Maps display divided geographical areas or regions that are coloured, shaded or patterned in relation to a data variable. This provides a way to visualise values over a geographical area, which can show variation or patterns across the displayed location. It can be used to visualize the distribution of a particular species within a geographical region.

Choropleth maps provide an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area or show the level of variability within a region. A heat map is similar but does not use geographic boundaries.

### 4 Cartogram
![Cartogram](assets/spatial/cartogram.png)

A cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or GNP – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted, sometimes extremely, in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as nomographs.
### 5 Dot distribution map
![Dot Distribution Map](assets/spatial/dotdistributed.jpg)

A dot distribution map, or dot density map, is a map type that uses a dot symbol to show the presence of a feature or a phenomenon. Dot maps rely on a visual scatter to show spatial pattern.
### 6 Thematic map
![Thematic Map](assets/spatial/thematic.png)

Thematic maps emphasize the spatial pattern of geographic attributes or statistics about places and relationships between places. For example, while a reference map might show the locations of cities, a thematic map might also represent the population of those cities. A reference map might show bank locations, while a thematic maps shows average income in an area. It’s the difference between mapping places and mapping data.


### 7 Contour line
![Counter Line](assets/spatial/counter.jpg)

A contour line (also isoline, isopleth, or isarithm) of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value, so that the curve joins points of equal value. It is a plane section of the three-dimensional graph of the function f(x, y) parallel to the x, y plane. In cartography, a contour line (often just called a "contour") joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as mean sea level. A contour map is a map illustrated with contour lines, for example a topographic map, which thus shows valleys and hills, and the steepness or gentleness of slopes. The contour interval of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive contour lines.

## Temporal
### 1 Bubble chart

![Bubble Chart](assets/temporal/bubblechart.PNG)
Bubble charts or bubble graphs are extremely useful graphs for comparing the relationships between data objects in 3 numeric-data dimensions: the X-axis data, the Y-axis data, and data represented by the bubble size. Essentially, bubble charts are like XY scatter graphs except that each point on the scatter graph has an additional data value associated with it that is represented by the size of a circle or “bubble” centered around the XY point.

### 2 Timeline
![Timeline](assets/temporal/timeline.png)

A timeline is a display of a list of events in chronological order. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates paralleling it, and usually contemporaneous events; a Gantt chart is a form of timeline used in project management.
### 3 Gantt chart
![Gantt chart](assets/temporal/gantt.png)

A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project.

### 4 Stream Graph
![Stream Graph](assets/temporal/streamgraph.png)

A streamgraph, or stream graph, is a type of stacked area graph which is displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing, organic shape.

### 5 Nightingale Rose Chart
![Nightingale Rose Chart](assets/temporal/rose.jpg)

This chart was famously used by statistician and medical reformer, Florence Nightingale to communicate the avoidable deaths of soldiers during the Crimean war.

Nightingale Rose Charts are drawn on a polar coordinate grid. Each category or interval in the data is divided into equal segments on this radial chart. How far each segment extends from the centre of the polar axis depends on the value it represents. So each ring from the centre of the polar grid can be used as a scale to plot the segment size and represent a higher value. Therefore, it’s important to notice with Nightingale Rose Charts that it’s the area, rather than the radius of a segment that represents its value.

The major flaw with Nightingale Rose Charts is that the outer segments are given more emphasis because of their larger area size. This disproportionately represents increases in value.
### 6 Sankey Diagram
![Sankey Diagram](assets/temporal/shankychart.PNG)

Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.
### 7 Alluvial Diagram
![Alluvial Diagram](assets/temporal/alluvial.png)

Alluvial diagrams can also be used to illustrate patterns of flow on a fixed network over time. The Users Flow feature of Google Analytics uses alluvial diagrams to graphically represent how visitors move among the nodes (individual pages) on a web sites[citation needed].

## Taxonomic
### 1 Pie chart
Pie charts are generally used to show proportional data in the form of slice of pie.

Pie chart can be used to represent percentage of different species in biodiversity data.

### 2 Word Cloud

![Word Cloud](assets/taxonomical/wordcloud.PNG)
A visualisation method that displays how frequently words appear in a given body of text, by making the size of each word proportional to its frequency. All the words are then arranged in a cluster or cloud of words. Alternatively, the words can also be arranged in any format: horizontal lines, columns or within a shape.



### 3 Bubble cloud
Bubble cloud are very similar to word cloud. Item with more frequency are in a bigger bubble than other items.

### 4 Bar chart, Radial bar chart
Bar Charts represent data as horizontal or vertical bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the value of the variable at theat point in time.

In Biodiversity data, bar charts can help to view density of different speices in pertiular year.

### 5 Dendrogram
![Dendrogram](assets/taxonomical/dendrogram.png)

A dendrogram is a diagram representing a tree. This diagrammatic representation is frequently used in different contexts:
### 6 Radial tree
![Radial Tree](assets/taxonomical/radial.png)

A radial tree, or radial map, is a method of displaying a tree structure (e.g., a tree data structure) in a way that expands outwards, radially. It is one of many ways to visually display a tree,with examples extending back to the early 20th century. In use, it is a type of information graphic.
### 7 Hyperbolic tree
It can be used to find relation of one class with another class

### Gauge
These gauges can be used to visualize amount of different category in data

### Org Chart
This is a tree down structure and can be used to find relation of one class with another calss
